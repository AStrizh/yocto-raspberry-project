Creating a Raspberry Pi image for my Operating Systems course

Due to the size and complexity of the yocto project I am only uploading the changes I have made after going through the Quick Build tutorial: https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html

So far:
  - Modified bblayers.conf and local.conf to include instructions for Raspberry Pi
  - Cloned the Raspberry Pi layer into the yocto folder. It has not been shared here because it is yet another package with a large number of files (git clone https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi.git)
